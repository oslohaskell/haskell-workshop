{-
    The 'main' function is the entry point of the program
-}
main = putStrLn "Hello World"

    Let's break that down:

        * `main` is a function definition. It doesn't take any arguments, and prints something to the console.

        * `putStrLn` is a function that prints a given string to the console

{-
   Now the very first "exercise" is to change the `myName` function to
   return your name:
-}
myName = "N/A"

{-
  ... then run the tests again.  You passed a test, right? Congrats.
